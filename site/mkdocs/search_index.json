Create an AppFriends Application\n\n\nBefore start using AppFriends, you need to create an application on the \ndashboard\n Users in the same application can talk to each other and you only need one application for all the platforms you want to support.\n\n\n2. Integrate AppFriends SDK\n\n\nUsing Cocoapods\n\n\nTo integrate AppFriends iOS SDK to your Xcode iOS project, add this line in your \nPodfile\n\n\npod 'AppFriendsUI'\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso, add \nuse_frameworks!\n to the file. eg.\n\n\nplatform\n \n:\nios\n,\n \n\"8.0\"\n\n\nuse_frameworks\n!\n\n\n...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo see an sample app of how to use AppFriendsUI, please checkout our repo:\n\n\n\n\nGithub Sample App Repo\n\n\n\n\nIf you don't want any of the UI components we provide, you can directly interact with the platform API, and we have a core framework to use for that purpose:\n\n\npod 'AppFriendsCore'\n\n\n\n\n\n3.

App_Secret  is the secret used to sign the requests coming from your application.  Admin_Secret  is the secret used to sign the requests coming directly from your server. For example, your server can send a request via AppFriends REST API to update a user's token or you can export all the social graph data with your admin secret.  These values play very important role in authenticating your requests, so please keep them away from the bad guys.",
