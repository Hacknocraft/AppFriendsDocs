## One on One Chat
A one on one chat is a private chat between two users. You can't add more users to the conversation. 

## Private Group Chat
A private group chat is between multiple users. Users in the conversation can add more users to this conversation.

## Open Channel Chat
An open channel chat is visible to everyone. However, each user can only join one open channel at a time.
