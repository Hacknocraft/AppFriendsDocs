## Mobile
AppFriends has native SDKs that make integration for iOS and Android much easier.

### iOS
The iOS SDK can be integrated into existing Xcode iOS projects. There are two SDK frameworks for you to use. If you don't want to use our provided UI, you can integrate the [AppFriendsCore](https://github.com/laeroah/AppFriendsCoreFramework) framework, which has no UI components but helps you communicate with the AppFriends platform. There is also the [AppFriendsUI](https://github.com/laeroah/AppFriendsUI) framework, which contains a lot of convenient UI components for you to quickly implement chat in your app. For details, please read the [iOS SDK guide](ios/quick_start.md).

### Android
The Android SDK can be integrated into existing Android projects. For details,
please read [Android SDK guide](android/quick_start.md). A sample android application can be found [here](https://github.com/hacknocraft/AppfriendsAndroidSample).

## Server API
AppFriends has comprehensive REST APIs for you to use. There are two types of APIs: [Application API](api/applicationapi.md) and [Admin API](api/adminapi.md).

## Admin Portal
You can control the widget by logging into the [admin portal](https://appfriends.hacknocraft.com/) with your AppFriends account.
